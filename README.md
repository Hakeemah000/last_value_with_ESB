# Run the default ESP on the wokwi site and show the last value in Mysql



-------------------------------------------------
####

There are many codes ready to run the default ESP, but there are some modifications that the user must work on, which is the programming to be added to the ESP for the hosting site, and here is the programming code for showing the last value in Mysql, which was coded for it and is available on my Github page.

## How to show the last value on the ESP

- Using a hosting site, for me I used a free hosting site for one site (Googiehost), I learned how to make the site work from clips on YouTube.
- We should now have a link that shows us the last value in Mysql.
- Finally, add the link in the wokwi code and the last value will be shown to you.
